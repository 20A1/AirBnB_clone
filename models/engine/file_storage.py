    Serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances

    Some of the attributes and methods used to accomplish this are:

        - __objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects by
        <class name>.id (ex: to store a BaseModel object with id=12121212, the
        key will be BaseModel.12121212)

        The above attributes are private and they belong to the class, Some
        public instance methods include:
        - all(self): returns the dictionary __objects
        - new(self, obj): sets in '__objects' the 'obj' with key
        <obj class name>.id
        - save(self): serializes '__objects' to the JSON file
        (path: __file_path)
        - reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if the
        JSON file (__file_path) exists; otherwise, do nothing
